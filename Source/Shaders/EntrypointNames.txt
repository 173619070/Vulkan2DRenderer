// GLSL and Spir-V lack support for multiple entrypoints per shader program,
// this system eliminates that to some extent. Shaders with the same interface
// can now be contained within a single file with custom entrypoints. Final
// spir-v is saved in a C++ header file for each of the entrypoints. To use
// entrypoints in GLSL, make any function void <EntryPointName>(void) and add
// that entrypoint name here. One similarly named entrypoint per stage,
// different stages can use the same entrypoint name, for example name
// MultitexturedTriangle can be used in both vertex and fragment shaders.
// Any line after -> // is considered a comment, similarly to C++.

// One entrypoint name per line, only white space and comments around it.
